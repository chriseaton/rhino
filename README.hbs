# Rhino

> !!New project - not ready yet!

Rhino is a production-focused Node.js Microsoft SQL Server driver wrapper that incorporates pooling and is powered by the Microsoft-backed 
[tedious](http://tediousjs.github.io/tedious/api-connection.html#function_newConnection) driver. 

Rhino purposefully uses very few dependencies and is a solid SQL driver implementation built for production use. It 
employs a pure promise and async/await enabled API usable in modern Node.JS programs. Additionally, Rhino makes 
connection pooling management totally transparent - dealing with all the internal connection management for you. This 
means you can focus on running queries, not managing connections.

Rhino has several advantages over existing `tedious` wrappers:

1. Pure async/await design.
2. Works out-of-the box with vanilla `Promise`s.
3. Automagic pooling. It's all handled for you.

## Installation

```sh
npm i rhino --save
```

## Quick Start

```js
const rhino = require('rhino');

...
let pool = await rhino.create({
    server: 'localhost',
    authentication: {
        options: {  
            userName: "testuser",
            password: "mypassword"
        }
    },
    pool: {
        min: 0,
        max: 10
    }
});
let results = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM dbo.People');
console.log(`Count: ${results.count}`);
console.log(results.rows);
```

### Transactions

```js
    let tx = null;
    try {
        tx = await pool.transaction();
        let results = await tx
            .query('INSERT INTO dbo.People (Code, FullName) VALUES (434,\'John Bircham\')')
            .query('INSERT INTO dbo.People (Code, FullName) VALUES (@code, @name)', { code: 322, name: 'Amy Smith' })
            .query('DELETE FROM dbo.People WHERE Code = 341')
            .commit();
        console.log('Transaction committed.');
    } catch (err) {
        if (tx) tx.rollback();
        throw;
    }
```

## Unit Testing
Unit-testing this driver requires a Microsoft SQL Server instance.
Due to the fragile nature of the database unit-testing, and to avoid collisions with other users, it's recommended
to use the process described below ([docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-engine) is required).

### 1. Build the image.
To get started, build our testing docker image:
```
docker build ./test --build-arg SA_PASSWORD="YourStr0ng_PasswordHERE" -t rhino:test
```

### 2. Run the container.
You need to run the `rhino:test` container from the built image. This will spin up the server and run the install 
script. It is usually ideal to run the container in daemon mode (`-d`), as the container will stay alive until stopped.

```
docker run -d -p 1433:1433 rhino:test
```

When run using the command above, the docker server will be accessible on localhost port 1433.

### 3. Setup testing environment.
Configure a `.env` file in the root project folder and define the variables for connecting:
```
RHINO_MSSQL_HOST = localhost
RHINO_MSSQL_USER = sa
RHINO_MSSQL_PASSWORD = YourStr0ng_PasswordHERE
```

### 4. Run tests.
Now that the test database server is up and running, you can run the Rhino unit-tests:

```
npm test
```

#### Troubleshooting
You can view the container logs to see the output from the server, including any runtime failures.

##### Show the running containers:
```
docker container ls
```

##### Show the output from a container:
```
docker container logs {container ID or Name here}
```

## Updating the API/Readme
The `README.md` file in this project is generated using the `js-to-markdown` package, essentially merging the JSdoc 
output into the `README.hbs` handlebars template file.

To rebuild the `README.md` file, simply run:
```
npm run doc
```

## Issues / Requests / Contributing
Please utilize the [issues](issues/) on the project to report a problem or provide feedback. Additional contributors are welcome.

1. Make sure the issue is with `rhino` and *not* the `[tedious](https://github.com/tediousjs/tedious/issues)` package. 
2. Gather details, your node and `rhino` version.
3. Provide as much information as possible, including steps to reporoduce the issue. Or better yet, provide a resolution with a merge request.
